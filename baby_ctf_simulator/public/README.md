We heard you like playing CTFs, so we made this [CTF simulator] for you! This is
what we used to practice hosting this CTF. We hope it will be of use to you for
the next CTF you host!

Hint:

There should be one obvious vulnerability that is hard to exploit. The challenge is figuring out how to circumvent the mitigations in place. If you think you found it, look closely at what's keeping you from getting what you want.
